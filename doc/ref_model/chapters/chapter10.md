## 10.1 Introduction.

The development of this Reference Model is in its initialization stage and it will go through several iteration cycles before it is adding the full intended value to the community. Growing pains are expected. To orient the reader even further, it is important to understand this model is also the first component in the establishment of an entire Common NFVI Lifecycle Framework--see also diagram #X:

Key Components of The Common NFVI Lifecycle Framework (Working Draft)

Reference Model
Reference Architecture
Reference Implementation
Verification & Validation
Lifecycle Feedback Loops

As the first component, the Reference Model will be structured and iterated so that it plays its part as the foundation on which the other four components of the framework are built out. Overall, the framework itself will iterate into a fully functioning ecosystem as the details and alignments between the framework components are designed, developed, and deployed.

Going forward, this chapter is dedicated to identifying the key challenges and detailed gaps found in the course the development--to ensure the Reference Model is adding the strategic and tactical value intended over time. Should a challenge or gap not be identified and assuming it is not clearly addressed in the model itself, the community may assume the challenge or gap will remain an unknown. Therefore, the community is welcomed to engage with and raise an issue with the appropriate working group(s) to close the issue. In this manner, the Reference Model can continuously improve.

## 10.2 Challenges.

### Challenge 1

The initial challenge was launching the Reference Model as an MVP and then gathering and incorporating necessary feedback from the community on the initial assumptions, and then iterating foundational constructs of the model with that feedback. This release includes the results of a significant effort to incorporate the feedback. Of course, alignment efforts will always continue.

### Challenge 2
The next challenge ahead is getting to a stable working version from which all stakeholders in the VNF value-chain can begin to extract the intended value of a Common NFVI. The next maturity level is reached when the Reference Model has stabilized enough for stakeholders to begin to intake the model into their own VNF development and deployment cycles.

## 10.3 Gaps.

### Gaps

This section includes links to all existing open issues in the development of the Reference Model and Reference Architecture components of the Common NFV Lifecycle Framework. Each issue is captured in the CNTT document repository and is viewable there as a reference and a work in progress item. Planned future framework components which are being built out as we speak are also referenced as placeholders for future as artifacts related to these components are produced and released.
